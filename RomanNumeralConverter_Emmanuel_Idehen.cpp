/*
 * Roman Numeral Converter
 * Write a program that displays the roman numeral equivalent of any decimal number
 * between 1 and 20 that the user enters. The roman numerals should be stored in an array of
 * strings and the decimal number that the user enters should be used to locate the array element
 * holding the roman numeral equivalent. The program should have a loop that allows
 * the user to continue entering numbers until an end sentinel of 0 is entered.
 * Input validation: Do not accept scores less than 0 or greater than 20.
 *

/*
 Psuedo code:
 Create an array, RomanNumeral of size 21( storing the first numeral in position 1 since arrays starts from 0)
 Create a do while loop to take input from user and continues as long as the user doesn't input 0
 Check if the choice of number is between the range of values!
 if in range, output corresponding array position!
 If not, an error has occured
 if 0, exit

 Test Case(1):
 
 
 To exit at any time press 0
 Enter your choice of number between 1 & 20: 2
 The equivalent numeral number for 2 is II
 
 
 
 
 Test Case(2):
 
 
 To exit at any time press 0
 Enter your choice of number between 1 & 20: -1
 The number you entered is not accepted !
 
 Test Case(3):
 
 
 To exit at any time press 0
 Enter your choice of number between 1 & 20: 20
 The equivalent numeral number for 20 is XX
 
 
 To exit at any time press 0
 Enter your choice of number between 1 & 20: -20
 
 The number you entered is not accepted !
 
 To exit at any time press 0
 Enter your choice of number between 1 & 20: 0
 Program ended with exit code: 0
